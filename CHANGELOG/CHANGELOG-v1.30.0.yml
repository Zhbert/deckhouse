        Now grafana using direct (proxy) type for deckhouse datasources (main, longterm, uncached),
        because direct(browse) datasources type is depreated now. And alerts don't work with direct
        data sources.

        Provisioning datasources from secret instead configmap. Deckhouse datasources need client
        certificates to connect to  prometheus or trickter. Old cm leave to prevent mount error
        while terminating.
